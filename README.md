# ConstraintSatisfactionProblem-sudokuAI

The program is able to find any number of solutions within one sudoku puzzle.
It's based on the Constraint Satisfaction Problem approach.

In order to try it out just create an empty C# console app, place your csv data
in the 'Saves' directory, get familiar with Loader class and build solution.

Default loader takes .csv files in following order: id;difficulty;puzzle;solution.
'Puzzle' is necessary, others can be empty.
